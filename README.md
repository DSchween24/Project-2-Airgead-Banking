CS-210 Project 2 - Interest With and Without Monthly Payments

/**
* CS-210 project 2 to implement and display the users specific investment and final amount in a year. 
* Create a banking account dependant on interest with and without monthly payments.
* First, calculate the interest accumulation without monthly additions to the plan.
*  Record the interest acumulated without additional monthly payments.
* Then, create a new amount of money accumulated with monthly payments.
* The interest rate will be affected accordingly to monthly contribution.
* Mathematical functions and string functions are priority in this project.
* String manipulation and string functions also help the main() file run.
* Functions are declared outside of Main() for simplicity and industry standards.
* // Comments are necessary to help other programmers follow the code. 
* Main() program is used for functionality, and source.ccp and header.h files do the utility work.
* The header file declares the functions needed for the program to run, the source.ccp file works the functions for the desired outcome,
* and main.ccp utilizes the functions to work the program.
* Constructor functions help declutter main() and call the functions when necessary, rather than embedding the code into main.
* Main() displays the necessary information when the program runs. String manipulation aids the display process.
* In the end, the user should be able to determine the final amount invested with or without monthly contributions, and 
* displayed properly.
* If I were to improve on my program I would use more embedded library files, and more importantly,
* embed "try/catch" exception handling to help the program run smoother with less restriction.
