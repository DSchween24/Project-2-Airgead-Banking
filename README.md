* String manipulation and string functions also help the main() file run.
* Functions are decalred outside of Main() for simplicity and industry standards.
* // Comments are necessary to help other programmmers follow the code. 
* Main() program is used for functionalitly, and source.ccp and header.h files do the utility work.
* The header file delares the functions needed for the program to run, the source.ccp file works the functions for the desired outcome,
* and main.ccp utilizes the functons to work the program.
* Constructor functons help declutter main() and call the functions when neccessary, rather than embedding the code into main.
* Main() displays the necessary information when the program runs. String manipulation aids the display process.
* In the end, the user should be able to determine the final amount invested with or without monthly contributions, and displayed propely.
